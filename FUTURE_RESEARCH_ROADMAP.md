## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (Months 1-3)

### 1.1 FPAA Implementation Priority (2025 Updated)
FPAA (Field Programmable Analog Arrays) offer 10,000x power efficiency vs digital systems according to 2025 research.

**Current Neuromorphic Hardware Landscape (2025)**:
- Intel Loihi 3: 10M neurons for robotics/sensory processing
- BrainChip Akida 2: On-chip learning for consumer devices  
- SynSense Speck: Ultra-low power vision for AR/VR
- Qualcomm Zeroth: Mobile/IoT edge AI optimization

**Immediate Actions**:
```python
# Target FPAA implementation sequence
1. Layer 4 (L4) - Sensory input processing
   - Bandpass filters map directly to analog circuits
   - Edge detection via op-amp differentiators
   - Validation: Compare FPAA vs Python simulation

2. Layer 2/3 (L2/3) - Associative processing  
   - Hebbian learning via analog multipliers
   - Lateral coupling through resistive networks
   - Field coupling via capacitive elements

3. Inter-layer connections
   - Analog signal routing between layers
   - Gain control via voltage-controlled amplifiers
   - Timing delays through RC circuits
```

**Why FPAA First**: 
- Analog computation is orders of magnitude more power-efficient
- Field coupling effects are natural in analog circuits
- Real-time performance without digital sampling artifacts
- Direct pathway to neuromorphic chip implementation

### 1.2 Essential Neuroscience Background
Given your technical background, here's the neuroscience you need:

**Cortical Column Fundamentals**:
- **Minicolumn**: ~80-120 neurons, basic processing unit
- **Macrocolumn**: ~10,000 neurons, functional unit (what you've implemented)
- **Laminar Organization**: Each layer has distinct connectivity patterns
- **Canonical Microcircuit**: Standardized pattern across all cortical areas

**Key Neuroscience Concepts for AI**:
1. **Predictive Processing**: Brain constantly predicts sensory input
2. **Hierarchical Feature Extraction**: Lower layers = edges, Higher layers = concepts
3. **Attention Mechanisms**: Top-down modulation of processing
4. **Binding Problem**: How separate features become unified percepts
5. **Global Workspace Theory**: Consciousness as information integration

**Critical Papers to Read**:
- Mountcastle (1997): "The columnar organization of the neocortex"  
- Hawkins & Blakeslee (2004): "On Intelligence" (accessible introduction)
- Friston (2010): "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory"

### 1.3 Multi-Column Network Architecture
```python
class CorticalSheet:
    """Network of interconnected cortical columns"""
    
    def __init__(self, rows=8, cols=8, column_size=64):
        self.topology = self._create_topology(rows, cols)
        self.columns = self._create_columns(column_size)
        self.global_workspace = GlobalWorkspace()
        
    def _create_topology(self, rows, cols):
        # Distance-based connectivity
        # Local excitation, distant inhibition
        # Retinotopic/tonotopic mapping
        pass
