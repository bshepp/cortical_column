This project is developed for research into artificial consciousness and 
neuromorphic computing. The implementation is based on biological cortical 
column principles translated into analog/digital hybrid systems.

Research Purpose: This software is intended to advance the understanding of 
consciousness, neural computation, and brain-inspired artificial intelligence.

Hardware Integration: Designed for implementation on Field Programmable Analog 
Arrays (FPAA) and integration with quantum computing resources.

Ethical Use: This research is intended for beneficial applications in 
artificial intelligence, environmental monitoring, and scientific discovery.
Users are encouraged to consider the ethical implications of consciousness 
research and artificial intelligence development.
